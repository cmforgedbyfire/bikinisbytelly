            <h2>Agreement to Terms</h2>
            <p>By accessing and using this website, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service.</p>
            
            <h2>Products</h2>
            <p>All bikinis sold on this website are handmade to order. Colors and styles may vary slightly from photos due to the handmade nature of our products and screen display differences.</p>
            
            <h2>Orders</h2>
            <h3>Processing Time</h3>
            <p>Handmade orders typically take 2-3 weeks to complete before shipping. Processing times may be longer during peak seasons.</p>
            
            <h3>Custom Orders</h3>
            <p>Custom orders require approval and payment before production begins. Once approved and in production, custom orders cannot be cancelled.</p>
            
            <h3>Cancellations</h3>
            <p>Standard orders may be cancelled within 24 hours of purchase. After production begins, orders cannot be cancelled.</p>
            
            <h2>Pricing and Payment</h2>
            <p>All prices are in USD. We accept payment through Stripe (credit cards, debit cards). Payment is due at time of purchase.</p>
            
            <h2>Shipping</h2>

            <h2>Returns and Exchanges</h2>
            <p>Due to the custom, made-to-order nature of our products, we do not accept returns for change of mind. See our Returns & Exchanges policy for quality issues and fit concerns.</p>
